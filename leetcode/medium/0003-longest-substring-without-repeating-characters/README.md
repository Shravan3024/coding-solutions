# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given a string `s`, find the length of the  **longest**   **substring**  without duplicate characters.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= s.length <= 105
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            Set<Character> charSet = new HashSet<>();
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                if (charSet.contains(s.charAt(j))) {
                    break;
                } else {
                    charSet.add(s.charAt(j));
                    res = Math.max(res, j - i + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
